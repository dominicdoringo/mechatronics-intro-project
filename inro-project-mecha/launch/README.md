Python Multiprocessing

Requirements
Processes must end/fall through when SharedMemoryWrapper.running.value is false
Keep Kill button and read_can implementation
You need the Sub to test it, so come into the trailer
OR you can run a try except to catch for non-existent can server
Create at least 2 processes

Do something cool:
Get the intro template from github
Ideas(motors)
Go to github and grab the motor interface/wrapper
Stable state
Follow Person/Color
Ideas(no motors)
Sensor data to web server (cherrypy?)


run ./roborun on startup

if things go south ./robokill
